    Machines API

    # Introduction  Fly Machines are the compute behind the Fly.io platform. They are fast-launching VMs that can be started and stopped at subsecond speeds. A Machine is the configuration and state for a single VM running on our platform. Every Machine will belong to a Fly App; Apps can have more than one Machine. Read more [here](https://fly.io/docs/machines/).  The Machines REST API allows you to provison and manage Apps, Machines and Volumes on the Fly.io platform. To manage other Fly.io resources like organizations, use the [GraphQL API](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domains-with-fly/#graphql-api-notes).  ## Authentication  All requests must include the Fly API Token in the HTTP Headers as follows:  ``` Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN] ```  You can get your API token using [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) by running `fly auth token`  ## Base URL  The easiest (and recommended) way to connect to the Machines API is to use the public `api.machines.dev` endpoint, a simpler and more performant alternative to connecting over WireGuard. You can still access your Machines directly over a WireGuard VPN, and use the private Machines API endpoint: `http://_api.internal:4280`. This method requires more setup.  Follow the [instructions](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/#private-network-vpn) to set up a permanent WireGuard connection to your Fly.io [IPv6 private network](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/). Once youâ€™re connected, Fly internal DNS should expose the Machines API endpoint at: `http://_api.internal:4280`  ## Response Codes  The API uses conventional HTTP status codes to signal whether a request was successful or not.  Typically, 2xx HTTP status codes denote successful operations, 4xx codes imply failures related to the user, and 5xx codes suggest problems with the infrastructure.  | Status | Description                                 | | :----: | ------------------------------------------- | | `200`  | Successful request.                         | | `201`  | Created successfully.                       | | `202`  | Successful request. No content.             | | `400`  | Check that the parameters were correct.     | | `401`  | The API key used was missing or invalid.    | | `404`  | The resource was not found.                 | | `5xx`  | Indicates an error with Fly.io API servers. |
