|**policy** | [**PolicyEnum**](#PolicyEnum) | * no - Never try to restart a Machine automatically when its main process exits, whether thatâ€™s on purpose or on a crash. * always - Always restart a Machine automatically and never let it enter a stopped state, even when the main process exits cleanly. * on-failure - Try up to MaxRetries times to automatically restart the Machine if it exits with a non-zero exit code.
